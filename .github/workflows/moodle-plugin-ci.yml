        # WORKAROUND 17/04/2025: The following code is a workaround for the "File is stale and needs to be rebuilt" error
        # This occurs when AMD modules import Moodle core dependencies
        # See issue: https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/350
        # This workaround should be removed once the issue is fixed upstream

        # Load NVM and use the version from .nvmrc
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

        # Go to moodle directory
        cd moodle

        # Use NVM to set Node version and ensure grunt-cli is installed
        nvm use
        npm install
        npm install -g grunt-cli
